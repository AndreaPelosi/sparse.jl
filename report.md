# *SPARSE* Project Report 

## Andrea Pelosi, University of Roma TRE


In this document we present *SPARSE*, a Julia package developed as part of the course [IN480 - Parallel and Distributed Computing](http://www.dia.uniroma3.it/~paoluzzi/web/did/calcoloparallelo/2021/). 
In *SPARSE*, we port and benchmark a graph algorithm built upon GraphBLAS, a mathematical abstraction to represent and operate with graphs using just a narrow set of linear algebra primitives.

*SPARSE* source code can be found at [sparse.jl](https://github.com/AndreaPelosi/sparse.jl).
